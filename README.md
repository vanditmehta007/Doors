## Plan
- Theme - Strange Places
- Action - Travel to different places (screens) by different doors until you make it out of the places maze into the outer space.
- Elements - Doors , Player , Stairs .


You need keys to open doors.

To get the keys you travel the different screens.

Each screen will have multiple doors , to different screens , they will change their destination screens randomly (light)

Each screen will have stairs matching the theme of the screen 

## Logic for finding the keys and connect it to the random doors logic 
-  Timer for the stairs to rotate and the doors to randomize .
- Hot and cold indicator for finding the key 
- Make the key fade in from invisibility as the player nears the key . 
- Find all the keys respective to the strange places 
- Then find the golden door to reach outer space and end.
