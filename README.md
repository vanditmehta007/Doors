# Door to Reality: The Story

## The Explorer's Log

You are a **Multidimensional Explorer**, traversing the infinite layers of reality.
During a routine jump between stable planes, your **Tether**—the lifeline that anchors you to your home dimension—snapped.

You are now adrift in the **Shift**, a chaotic "space between spaces" where reality is unstable.

## The Curse of the Shift

In this unstable state, the universe rejects your presence.
**Every 5 seconds**, the dimension around you violently shifts to a new random location:
- A Calm Garden
- A Liminal Office
- The Grid (Tron)
- An Underwater Castle
- Outer Space

This forced teleportation tears at your molecular structure. Your **Health** drains with every shift. If it reaches zero, you will dissolve into the void forever.

## The Only Way Out

Ancient interdimensional legends speak of the **Golden Orbs**.
These artifacts are fragments of pure stability, hidden across the chaotic dimensions.

Your mission is clear:
1.  **Survive** the shifts.
2.  **Locate** the Golden Orb in each dimension.
3.  **Collect** all orbs to forge a key.
4.  **Summon** the legendary **Golden Door**.

Only the Golden Door can bridge the gap back to **True Reality**.

*Move quickly, Explorer. The dimensions are hungry.*
